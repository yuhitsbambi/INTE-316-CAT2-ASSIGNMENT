Certainly! Let's tackle the three questions related to polynomial interpolation and approximation based on the given data points:

1. **Implementation of Lagrange Polynomial:**
   To compute the coefficients of the Lagrange polynomial that interpolates the data points \((x_i, y_i)\), we can use the following Python function:

   ```python
   def lagrange_interpolation(x_values, y_values, x):
       n = len(x_values)
       result = 0.0
       for i in range(n):
           term = y_values[i]
           for j in range(n):
               if i != j:
                   term *= (x - x_values[j]) / (x_values[i] - x_values[j])
           result += term
       return result
   ```

   You can call this function with your data points and the desired \(x\) value to obtain the interpolated value.

2. **Implementation of Newton's Divided Difference Method:**
   For Newton's method, we compute the divided differences recursively. Here's a Python function to find the coefficients of the Newton polynomial:

   ```python
   def divided_differences(x_values, y_values):
       n = len(x_values)
       coeffs = [y_values[0]]
       for i in range(1, n):
           temp = [y_values[j] for j in range(i, n)]
           for j in range(i):
               temp[j] = (temp[j + 1] - temp[j]) / (x_values[j + i] - x_values[j])
           coeffs.append(temp[0])
       return coeffs

   def newton_interpolation(x_values, y_values, x):
       coeffs = divided_differences(x_values, y_values)
       result = 0.0
       prod = 1.0
       for i in range(len(coeffs)):
           result += coeffs[i] * prod
           prod *= (x - x_values[i])
       return result
   ```

3. **Comparison and Discussion:**
   Both Lagrange and Newton methods yield the same polynomial, but their computational approaches differ. Lagrange uses explicit formulas, while Newton relies on divided differences. The choice depends on ease of implementation and numerical stability.

Feel free to use these functions and explore the interpolating polynomials! If you have any further questions or need clarification, don't hesitate to ask. ðŸ˜Š
